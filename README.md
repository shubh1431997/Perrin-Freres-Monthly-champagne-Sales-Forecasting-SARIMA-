Autoregressive Integrated Moving Averages
The general process for ARIMA models is the following:                                                                                                                   
Visualize the Time Series Data
Make the time series data stationary
Plot the Correlation and AutoCorrelation Charts
Construct the ARIMA Model or Seasonal ARIMA based on the data
Use the model to make predictions
Let's go through these steps!
